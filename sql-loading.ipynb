The benefits of driving an all wheel drive vehicle, such as this Cadillac Escalade Premium, include superior acceleration, improved steering, and increased traction and stability.

The Escalade's cabin is one of the most impressive, opulent interiors offered in an SUV, and ride quality and overall interior quality are top-notch. All the more impressive is the way the Escalade performs and handles considering its size and weight. The Hybrid version, although more expensive, doesn't give up any of the standard Escalade's luxury, handling, or ride quality, but does manage to get up to 50% better fuel economy. Interesting features of this model are opulent interior appointments, strong V8 performance, high-efficiency hybrid powertrain availability, comfortable ride and handling for such a big truck-based vehicle, impressive tow ratings, and Tough, stylish exterior We want all trades!

Source: Edmunds  * Driving the 2014 Ford Focus is incredibly fun and enjoyable. It has a dynamic design, addictive driving experience, and an interior that immerses you into something that is definitely more than just a car. The Focus comes in 7 models to pick from: the Base S Sedan, SE Sedan, SE Hatch, Titanium Sedan, ST, Titanium Hatch, and Electric. New for 2014, there\\'s a Sport Appearance Package for the SE, which has sport cloth seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and an available rear spoiler. Every drop of fuel is effectively used in the Focus with its 2.0L engine. Twin independent variable camshaft timing adds extra precision, contributing to fuel efficiency or power output. The electric power-assisted steering contributes to fuel efficiency as well. Plus, Active Grille Shutters help Focus make itself even more aerodynamic and fuel-efficient. This all helps Focus SE with the SFE Package achieve up to 40 MPG HWY, which equals less stops at the pump. For entertainment, there\\'s SYNC with MyFord Touch, standard on Titanium and Electric trims, and optional on SE and ST. On select models, luxury comes in the form of leather-trimmed seats, dual-zone electronic automatic temperature control, ambient lighting, and 2 Interior Style Packages that feature two-tone leather-trimmed seats, matching door-trim inserts, coordinated steering wheel trim and more. The new Focus ST is geared to get you to your destination quickly. Mash the aluminum accelerator pedal and you\\'ll be treated to the rollicking performance of its 252hp, 2.0L EcoBoost engine that\\'s linked to a 6-speed manual transmission. An overboost feature can sustain increased torque (from 3000 to 4500 rpm) for 15 seconds at a time enhancing its performance feel.

Reviews:  * Need room for eight, space for lots of cargo – or some mix of both – but don’t want the gas consumption or heft of a full-size SUV? Definitely don’t want a minivan? Give the 2014 GMC Acadia your attention. Source: KBB.com  * Compliant ride; massive cargo area; seating for up to eight passengers; top crash test scores. Source: Edmunds  * The 2014 GMC Acadia personifies a never say never attitude with its flexible, accommodating space and functionality. Featuring distinctive, bold lines, a confident stance, the Acadia comes with aluminum wheels and automatic on/off headlamps. Body color moldings keep a sleek uniform look. Additionally, there are roof-mounted luggage rails to make family outings as convenient as possible. The interior of the Acadia features attractive trim accents and a soft instrument panel wrap, as well as soothing ambient lighting accents. Additionally, there is underfloor storage behind the flat-folding third row. Rear Park Assist aids by providing audible warning sounds as the rear of the vehicle approaches an object. That, combined with a Rear Vision Camera, makes those complicated parking situations a breeze. A USB port allows you to connect a supported music device for your listening pleasure. All 2014 Acadia models now include two USB ports on the rear of the center console for charging phones and other portable devices. The Acadia is driven by a 3.6L V6 Engine capable of 288 hp at 6300 rpm. Plus, the torque is more than enough to handle a small boat or trailer. The Acadia also affords you the option of a 6-speed AWD automatic transmission or a 6-speed FWD automatic transmission. The dual exhaust allows for an even exhaust flow and are intentionally turned down to prevent any protrusion from the body. The Acadia gives you the extra peace of mind with its host of safety features. An array of air bags protects you from all angles.

Additionally, there are roof-mounted luggage rails to make family outings as convenient as possible. The interior of the Acadia features attractive trim accents and a soft instrument panel wrap, as well as soothing ambient lighting accents.

Why spend more money than you have to? This Hyundai Sonata will help you keep the extra money you'd normally spend on gas. In addition to being well-cared for, this Hyundai Sonata has very low mileage making it a rare find. More information about the 2014 Hyundai Sonata: The Hyundai Sonata stands out among mid-size sedans for offering one of the most generous sets of standard features. While most of its competition-- which includes the likes of the Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Malibu, Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima and Honda Accord --have been fully redesigned in the past couple of years, the Sonata is fully on par with those models. In usable interior space, cargo space, and ride comfort, the Sonata is a step ahead of many of its mid-size rivals. The Sonata has one of the best turning circles in its class, Hyundai points out; and for those who place a greater weight on fuel efficiency, there's a Sonata Hybrid that achieves EPA ratings of 38 mpg city, 40 highway. This model sets itself apart with refined look for 2014, passenger and cargo space, generous standard-feature set, smooth ride, and Fuel-efficient powertrains We want all trades!

Reviews:  * One of the more attractive interiors in the segment at an affordable price is tough to overlook. A refined 4-cylinder engine offers respectable fuel economy due in part to the new 9-speed automatic transmission. If it’s power you seek, the Pentastar V6 serves up 295 horsepower. Source: KBB.com  * Strong V6 engine; composed ride and handling; high-quality interior materials; slick infotainment interface; available all-wheel drive. Source: Edmunds  * The advanced engineering of the redesigned 2015 Chrysler 200 results in highly efficient, refined performance. The exterior design blends coupe-like proportions with a tasteful fit and finish. A dynamic stance, wind-swept profile, finely sculpted curves and aggressive wheel-to-body proportions result in a sophisticated road presence. The 200 redefines the sedan interior. A traditional center console is replaced with one that is ergonomic and space efficient. It combines climate controls, the Electric Park Brake and connectivity functions with storage features. A connection to a USB or auxiliary media hub is located under the cup holder. Controls for the available dual-zone automatic temperature control are in short reach and easy to use. The 200 fuel economic ratings speak for themselves. The 2.4L Tigershark MultiAir II four-cylinder engine provides up to 36mpg HWY, while the available 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine delivers up to 31mpg HWY with 295hp. The Rotary E-shift features a wide gear ratio spread provides smooth, indecipherable transfer between gears at all speeds. Standard on all 200 models (except the LX) the Uconnect 5.0 System includes a high-resolution 5in touchscreen, one year of SiriusXM Radio, Integrated Voice Command, Bluetooth technology, a media hub with mobile device integration and more. To keep driving safe, 200 models include standard steel cage construction and eight airbags that help deliver excellent occupant protection in front, side and rear impacts. Advanced accident avoidance features include available Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist. Class-exclusive features include available Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go functions, available Forward Collision Warning, and available Parallel Park Assist.

PLEASE CONTACT OUR SCHEDULING TEAM TO SET UP A VIP VISIT TODAY OR SHOP OUR EXPRESS SMART STORE! Reviews:  * When function and form are treated as one, engineering is elevated to an art form. The Mazda6 is the product of engineer and designer working in unison, daring to reimagine the automobile as a whole. It is the true definition of the modern sports sedan. The 2.5L SKYACTIV-G gasoline engine pushes the boundaries of innovation even further. Mazda engineers increased its torque output to 185 lb-ft, all without compromising fuel efficiency. Combine it with the ultra-responsive 6-speed SKYACTIV-MT manual or the smooth 6-speed SKYACTIV-Drive Sport automatic transmission and the result: 184 horsepower and an astounding EPA-estimated 38 MPG hwy (Up to 40 MPG hwy with Grand Touring 2.5L with AT and Technology Package). It all begins when you slide into the luxurious driver's sport seat and fire up with the push button start. With Mazda's newly available Commander Switch, you can control the available navigation system, sound system and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming conveniently from the center console. Other available features include leather trimmed upholstery and heated sports seats. The available fully integrated navigation system with a 7-inch touch-screen display features intuitive voice recognition.

What is a Pre-Purchase Inspection⁉️ A pre-purchase inspection is a type of inspection performed on a pre-owned vehicle before you buy it. During a pre-inspection check, our service technicians thoroughly inspect your vehicle and inform you of the overall condition. An inspection can let you know if there's any heavy wear and tear, so you'll know if you need to replace any parts soon. You can use this information to renegotiate your buying price or avoid a bad sale altogether. Purchasing a used vehicle can be risky. When excited buyers get emotionally caught up in the vehicle purchase, they often miss mechanical, cosmetic, and safety issues during visual inspections and test drives. Also, have your Carvana Post-Purchase done within 7 Days or get stuck w/ a Lemon🍋🚘🚫 Before you buy a Pre/Post-Owned vehicle, contact Circle City Tire at Tallmadge Automotive for a Pre-purchase inspection.
